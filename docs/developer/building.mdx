## Prerequisites

Before building llumen, ensure you have:

- **Rust** 1.70+ and Cargo
- **Node.js** 18+ and pnpm
- **Git**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pinkfuwa/llumen.git
cd llumen

# Build backend
cd backend
cargo build --release

# Build frontend
cd ../frontend
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Run
cd ../backend
cargo run --release
```

## Backend Build

The backend is written in Rust using Axum framework.

```bash
cd backend

# Development build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release --locked

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Build Options

- `--release`: Optimized build with smaller binary size
- `--locked`: Use exact dependency versions from Cargo.lock

## Frontend Build

The frontend uses Svelte 5 with Vite.

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Development server
pnpm dev

# Production build
pnpm build

# Type checking
pnpm check
```

The build output is in `frontend/build/` as static files.

## Using Just

Llumen includes a `justfile` for common tasks:

```bash
# Build everything
just build

# Run in development mode
just dev

# Run tests
just test

# Format code
just fmt
```

## Docker Build

Build using the provided multi-stage Dockerfile:

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t llumen .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 llumen
```

Or use docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Building Documentation

The documentation is built with Docusaurus:

```bash
cd docs

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Development server
pnpm start

# Production build
pnpm build

# Serve production build
pnpm serve
```

## Troubleshooting

### Rust Compilation Errors

Ensure you have the latest stable Rust:
```bash
rustup update stable
```

### Node/pnpm Issues

Clear cache and reinstall:
```bash
pnpm store prune
rm -rf frontend/node_modules
pnpm install
```

### Build Size

For smaller binaries, use:
```bash
cargo build --release
strip target/release/llumen
```
