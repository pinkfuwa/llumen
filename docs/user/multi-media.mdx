## PDF Upload

<Note>
    Openrouter has extended OpenAI's API to support PDF upload. A proxy is needed if you want to use other provider.
</Note>

### Supported Formats

- Standard PDF/A
- Text-based PDFs (not scanned images without OCR)
- Multi-page documents
- Password-protected PDFs (you'll be prompted for password)

### Use Cases

```
Summarize this research paper

What does the author say about [topic] in section 3?

Extract all the key findings

Create a bullet-point summary of each section
```

### Best Practices

- Use text-based PDFs for best results
- Large files take longer to process
- Ask specific questions about content
- Reference specific sections or pages

## Privacy & Security

- All processing happens locally
- Files are not stored permanently
- Temporary files cleared after session
- No external services used

## Troubleshooting
