## Overview

Llumen allows you to configure individual models with specific capabilities and parameters. This enables fine-tuned control over how each AI model behaves.

## Configuration Format

Model configurations are stored in TOML format. Each model has:
- **Display name** - Human-readable name shown in UI
- **Model ID** - Identifier used by the API provider
- **Capabilities** - What the model supports(optional)
- **Parameters** - Inference settings(optional)

## Basic Configuration

### Minimal Example

```toml
display_name = "GPT-OSS 20B"
# openrouter suffix are supported
model_id = "openai/gpt-oss-20b:nitro"
```

### Complete Example

```toml
display_name = "Claude 4.5 Sonnet"
model_id = "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet"

[capability]
image = true # upload image
audio = false # upload audio
ocr = "Mistral"
tool = true
json = true
reasoning = true

[parameter]
temperature = 0.7
top_p = 0.9
top_k = 40
repeat_penalty = 1.1
```

## Model Capabilities

Configure what features the model supports, image generation are always auto-detect(openrouter only).

<Note>
You don't need this if you are using openrouter.
Openrouter API allow llumen to detect it for you.
</Note>

### Input/Upload

Set `image`, `audio` to true to override auto-detection

### Structured output

- When set to true: deep research mode will be more accurate. Eliminate error like `"Here is research..." is not a valid plan`. 
- When set to false: deep research mode will retry once if error.
- When not set: Llumen will guess its support

### OCR Engine

```toml
[capability]
ocr = "Mistral"  # Options: "Native", "Text", "Mistral", "Disabled"
```

### Tool Use

- When set to true: search/deep research mode will be enable. 
- When set to false: normal mode only.
- When not set: Llumen will guess its support

### Reasoning

- When set to true: enable reasoning, generate nothing if model doesn't support it. 
- When set to false: no reasoning.
- When not set: Llumen will guess its support, enable if supported.

<Note>
Llumen support interleaved thinking(If model support it)
</Note>

## Model Parameters

Fine-tune inference behavior:

### Temperature

```toml
[parameter]
temperature = 0.7  # Range: 0.0 - 2.0
```

**Examples:**

```toml
# For coding assistance
temperature = 0.2

# For creative writing
temperature = 0.9

# For balanced chat
temperature = 0.7
```

### Top P (Nucleus Sampling)

```toml
[parameter]
top_p = 0.9  # Range: 0.0 - 1.0
```

Controls diversity by limiting token selection:

- **0.1** - Very focused, predictable
- **0.5** - Moderate diversity
- **0.9** - High diversity (recommended)
- **1.0** - All tokens considered

<Note>
  Use either `temperature` OR `top_p`, not both. OpenRouter recommends `top_p`.
</Note>

### Top K

```toml
[parameter]
top_k = 40  # Range: 1 - 100+
```

### Repeat Penalty

```toml
[parameter]
repeat_penalty = 1.1  # Range: 1.0 - 2.0
```

Reduces repetition in responses:

- **1.0** - No penalty (repetitive)
- **1.1** - Light penalty (recommended)
- **1.2-1.3** - Moderate penalty
- **1.5+** - Strong penalty (may affect quality)

## Configuring Models in Llumen

### Via Web Interface

1. Log in to llumen
2. Go to **Settings** → **Openrouter**
3. Add or edit model configurations
4. Save changes
