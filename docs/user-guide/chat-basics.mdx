## Conversation Fundamentals

### Starting a Conversation

Click "New Chat" or just start typing in the input box.

### Sending Messages

- **Type and press Enter**: Send immediately
- **Shift + Enter**: Add new line without sending
- **Click Send button**: Alternative to Enter

### Message Formatting

Llumen supports full Markdown:

```
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
`inline code`
[Links](https://example.com)

- Bullet lists
- Second item

1. Numbered lists
2. Second item
```

## Context and Memory

### Conversation Context

- Llumen remembers the entire conversation
- Refer to previous messages naturally
- Build on earlier topics

Example:
```
You: Explain REST APIs

Llumen: [explains REST]

You: How does that compare to GraphQL?
       ↑ "that" refers to REST from previous message
```

### Context Limits

- Each conversation has a token limit
- Older messages may be truncated
- Start new conversation for unrelated topics

## Effective Prompting

### Be Clear and Specific

❌ Poor: "How do I code?"
✅ Good: "How do I write a function in Python that reads a CSV file?"

### Provide Examples

```
Write a function similar to this but for JSON:

def read_csv(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        return csv.reader(f)
```

### Request Specific Formats

```
Explain dependency injection:
- Use simple language
- Give a code example in Rust
- Show both good and bad examples
```
