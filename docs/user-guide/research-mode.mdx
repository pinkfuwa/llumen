title: "Deep Research Mode"
description: "Autonomous agents for thorough investigation"
---

## Overview

Deep Research mode deploys autonomous agents to conduct comprehensive, multi-step research.

## Activating Research Mode

1. Click action menu in input
2. Select "Deep Research"
3. Mode indicator shows "Research"

## How It Works

1. **Planning**: Agent creates a research plan
2. **Investigation**: Systematically gathers information
3. **Analysis**: Synthesizes findings
4. **Report**: Presents comprehensive results

You'll see each step as it progresses.

## Best Use Cases

### Market Research

```
Research the current state of self-hosted AI tools. Include:
- Major players
- Feature comparisons
- Pricing models
- User sentiment
```

### Technical Deep Dives

```
Analyze the tradeoffs between different Rust web frameworks:
tokio/axum, actix-web, and rocket. Consider:
- Performance
- Ergonomics
- Community support
- Ecosystem
```

### Competitive Analysis

```
Compare documentation platforms:
- Mintlify
- GitBook
- Docusaurus
- ReadTheDocs

Focus on features, pricing, and developer experience.
```

### Strategic Planning

```
Research best practices for building a developer community around an open-source project
```

## Research Quality

### Depth vs Speed

Research mode is slower but much more thorough:
- Normal: Seconds, surface-level
- Search: ~30 seconds, cited facts
- Research: Minutes, comprehensive analysis

### Structuring Requests

Help the agent with clear structure:

```
Research [topic]. Please cover:
1. [Aspect 1]
2. [Aspect 2]
3. [Aspect 3]

Focus on [specific angle]
```

## Monitoring Progress

Watch the agent work:
- See which queries it runs
- Track information gathering
- Observe synthesis process
- Transparent decision-making

## Tips for Best Results

### Give Clear Scope

```
Research Rust web frameworks. Focus on production-ready options with good async support. Ignore experimental frameworks.
```

### Specify Depth

```
Do a shallow survey of 5-10 options, not an exhaustive analysis
```

or

```
Do an in-depth analysis of the top 3 options only
```

### Request Structure

```
Present findings as:
1. Executive summary
2. Detailed comparison table
3. Recommendations for different use cases
```
